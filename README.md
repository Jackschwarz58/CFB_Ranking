# College Football Ranking Site 2020
This is a web app project that is meant to be the one-stop-shop for college football weekly rankings, wether they be AP, Coaches, r/CFB, CBS, Playoff, etc. This is in its early stages right now so this readme will function as a bit of a notebook until the project is completed (hopefully before the season).

### Current Plan
Frontend User Interface is to be done using ReactJS, a framework new to me.
The backend work is mainly to be done in Python with a program that will run every week to scrape the new rankings. I will store these in a database in order to cut down the amount of time it takes to present these to the user. Some take longer and its nicer to have them all go at once. 

### UI Mockup
TBD

### Current Issues
Mainly learning Python more in-depth and becoming familiar somewhat with the limited amount of Pandas I am using.
